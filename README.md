# Browser-Based Digital Audio Workstation (Modulation)

## Description
This project is a browser-based Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) that leverages the Tone.js library for audio synthesis and processing. It introduces an intuitive, gesture-based interface for creating, deleting, and connecting audio nodes, streamlining the music production process directly within your web browser.

## Features
- **Gesture-Based Controls:** Create and delete nodes, and establish connections between them using simple gestures (drag and drop) for an intuitive user experience.
- **Tone.js Integration:** Built on top of the Tone.js library, offering a wide range of audio synthesis and processing capabilities.
- **Core and Source Nodes:** Currently supports the creation of core and source sections of Tone.js parameters are disabled for now.


## Current Limitations
- **Node Parameters:** Modification of node parameters is currently disabled and will be addressed in the next updates.

## Next Steps
- **Bind Node Parameters:** The immediate goal is to enable the binding of node parameters to the Tone.js object parameters, allowing for more detailed and refined control over the audio processing.
