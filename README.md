# Browser-Based Digital Audio Workstation (Modulation)

## Description
This project is a browser-based Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) that leverages the Tone.js library for audio synthesis and processing. It introduces an intuitive, gesture-based interface for creating, deleting, and connecting audio nodes, streamlining the music production process directly within your web browser.

- **Tone.js Integration:** Built on top of the Tone.js library, offering a wide range of audio synthesis and processing capabilities.
- **Almost all Tone.js nodes can be created**

## Current Limitations
- Besides a few bugs the daw is working correctly, there are still a few components missing but they will be handled in the design section.
- 
## Next Steps
- Improving UI/UX,
- complete missing components. (the rest of the components related to the design of the UI, the first thing to solve is the design)
